I am the third-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Elecetrical and Computer Engineering, New York University, under the supervision of Prof. Zhong-Ping Jiang. I received my Master's degree in Automation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Automation from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, adaptive/approximate dynamic programming, optimal control, robotics, and intelligent transportation.
